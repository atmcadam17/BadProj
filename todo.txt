Grading Guide and TODO list.

Grade D:

Done - There is a compiler warning in BlobStateMoving.cs. Fix it and explain (in a comment) what the problem was, and what effect it had on the game. 

Done - GameController.score is currently a private variable with a public function (AddScore) to change score. Replace both of these things with a public property called "Score" in the GameController class. This property should have a private backing variable and the Set function should contain the code currently in AddScore.

Grade C:
Done - Replace the Quintic/Out easing function in BlobStateShrinking with a Quartic/Out easing function.

Done - Bug: You can set the blob to "Shrinking" multiple times by clicking on it multiple times. Fix this bug so that the blob can't be set to Shrink while already in the Shrinking state.

Grade B:

Done - Override the Leave() function in BlobStateBlinking to add 1 point to the score every time a blob leaves the Blinking state.

Done - Implement the selection sort algorithm in the RemoveHighestBlobs() function in the GameConroller class.

Grade A:

Done - Add an extra state to the Blob state machine called BlobStateBlinking. In this state, the blob should blink on and off with a delay of half a second between blinks. This state should be entered after BlobStatePulsing. 

Find something else in the code that you could improve. Implement your improvement and leave a comment explaining your changes.

Note: If you can't get Git working and submit the assignment via NYU classes the highest grade available will be B.
